This is a simple c++ desktop application using Qt(4.8) coded in Netbeans.

It allows you to create 3D objects (cubes, pyramids and revolved objects) paint them, 
transform them (scale, rotate and translate) and enlighten them through the Phong lighting model.

An overview, in spanish, is available here http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8l1BN7ZjCQM
